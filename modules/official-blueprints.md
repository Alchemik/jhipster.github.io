# <i class="fa fa-star"></i> Officially supported blueprints

JHipster supports several official blueprints. These blueprints have two main goals:

* Enhance JHipster with new features using different languages and/or support
* Demonstrate how the main generator behavior can be modified to fit anyone's needs

## Kotlin

It replaces most of Java back-end code with Kotlin. Source code and documentation could be found here: [repository](https://github.com/jhipster/jhipster-kotlin).

Stream lead is: [Sendil Kumar](https://github.com/sendilkumarn).

## Vue.js

It replaces the whole front-end logic with Vue.js. Source code and documentation could be found here: [repository](https://github.com/jhipster/jhipster-vuejs).

Stream lead is: [Sahbi Ktifa](https://github.com/sahbi-ktifa).

## .Net

This is the first attempt to leave the Java environment and join .Net world. Source code and documentation could be found here: [repository](https://github.com/jhipster/jhipster-dotnetcore).

Stream lead is: [Daniel Petisme](https://github.com/danielpetisme).

## Node.js

It replaces the server java side with the NestJS Node framework. Source code and documentation could be found here: [repository](https://github.com/jhipster/generator-jhipster-nodejs).

Stream lead is: [Angelo Manganiello](https://github.com/amanganiello90).

## Micronaut

This blueprint supported and driven by people of the [Micronaut team](https://github.com/jhipster/generator-jhipster-micronaut/graphs/contributors) itself.
It replaces all server side code with a [Micronaut](https://micronaut.io/) application. 
Source code and documentation can be found here: [repository](https://github.com/jhipster/generator-jhipster-micronaut)

## Quarkus

This blueprint supported, in part by the JHipster sponsor [Entando](https://www.entando.com/), and driven by the JHipster community for a [supersonic, subatomic Java back-end](https://quarkus.io/).
Source code and documentation can be found here: [repository](https://github.com/jhipster/generator-jhipster-quarkus)
