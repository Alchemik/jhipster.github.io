# <i class="fa fa-star"></i> Officially supported blueprints

The JHipster team maintains several official blueprints. These blueprints have two main goals:

* Enhance JHipster with new features using different languages and/or support
* Demonstrate how the main generator behavior can be modified to fit anyone's needs

The blueprints below are ordered by the number of stars they have on GitHub.
