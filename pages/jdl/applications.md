***

### Syntax

The application declaration is done as follows:

```
application {
  config {
    <application option name> <application option value>
  }
  [entities <application entity list>]
}
```

  - Application configuration keys/values are specified under `config` (which must be inside `application`)
  - There can be 0, 1 or any application option as you want (provided they are valid)
  - Entities that will be generated inside the application are listed via `entities`, this is the recommended way to
    generate entities in applications.
    - This can be omitted but generating entities inside the app would require doing it:
      - from another JDL file inside the app
      - or with the CLI
  - The `entities` keyword is optional: you can omit it, but every entity in the JDL file will be generated inside the
    application

---

### Examples

#### Basic example

```jdl
application {
  config {
    baseName exampleApp
    applicationType gateway
  }
}
```

---

#### More than one application

```jdl
application {
  config {
    baseName exampleApp1
    applicationType microservice
    serverPort 9001
  }
}

application {
  config {
    baseName exampleApp2
    applicationType microservice
    serverPort 9002
  }
}

application {
  config {
    baseName exampleApp3
    applicationType gateway
    serverPort 9000
  }
}
```

---

#### With entities

```jdl
application {
  config {
    baseName exampleApp1
    applicationType microservice
    serverPort 9001
  }
  entities A
}

application {
  config {
    baseName exampleApp2
    applicationType microservice
    serverPort 9002
  }
  entities * except A
}

entity A
entity B
entity C
```

---

### Complete example breakdown

```jdl
application {
  config {
    baseName myMonolith
    applicationType monolith
  }
  entities * except C, D
}
application {
  config {
    baseName myGateway
    applicationType gateway
    serverPort 9042
  }
  entities * except A, B
}
application {
  config {
    baseName microserviceA
    applicationType microservice
  }
  entities C
}
application {
  config {
    baseName microserviceB
    applicationType microservice
    serverPort 8082
  }
  entities D
}
entity A
entity B
entity C
entity D
dto * with mapstruct
service * with serviceClass
paginate D with pager
```

Now, several things will happen when generating these applications and folders:
  - Four applications will be created:
    - myMonolith in `./myMonolith`, with the server port `8080`
    - myGateway in `./myGateway`, with the server port `9042`
    - microserviceA in `./microserviceA`, with the server port `8081`
      - Even though we didn't specify a server port, JHipster sets one by default.
      - For microservices, the default one is `8081`
      - For gateways and monoliths, it's `8080`
      - For UAA apps, it's `9999`
    - microserviceB in `./microserviceB` with the server port `8082`
  - Four entities will be generated
    - `A` and `B` in the monolith
    - `C` and `D` both in the gateway
      - `C` in the first microservice
      - `D` in the second microservice
  - The `microservice` option is implicit for `C` and `D`
    - Because they get generated on the two microservices, this option will be set by default.
  - Options work the same way as before

Note that the generator sets default values if they aren't present (like the `databaseType`).
JHipster Core does the exact same things for you.

### Microservice workflow

Dealing with microservices is a almost tricky, but the JDL gives you some options to handle your entities as you see fit.
With the `microservice <ENTITIES> with <MICROSERVICE_APP_NAME>` you can specify which entity gets generated in which microservice.

Take this setup for instance:
```
entity A
entity B
entity C
microservice A with firstMS
microservice B with secondMS
```

Given two JHipster applications ('firstMS' and 'secondMS'), here's what you're going to get if you import the JDL file
in the two applications:
  - In 'firstMS', entities `A` and `C` will be generated.
  - In 'secondMS', entities `B` and `C` will be generated.

`C` gets generated in both because if there's no microservice option specifying where this entity gets generated, it
will be generated everywhere.

If you decide to import this JDL in a monolith app, every entity will be generated (monoliths don't have restriction
options in the JDL).

_Note: if you want to make the same entity be generated in two different microservices, you can write two JDL files
instead of updating the JDL file. Everytime._

The previous example couldn't have been written like this:
```
entity A
entity B
entity C
microservice * except B with firstMS
microservice * except A with secondMS
```

Here's the result:
  - In 'firstMS', only the entity `C` will be generated
  - In 'secondMS', entities `B` and `C` will be generated.

It's because, at parsing-time, if an option overlaps with another, the latter takes precedence.
You can also create an entire microservice stack using JDL, [see this blog post](https://medium.com/@deepu105/create-full-microservice-stack-using-jhipster-domain-language-under-30-minutes-ecc6e7fc3f77) for example
